## Business & Data Understanding

According to Statistia, housing affordability is a significant issue in Australia that has sparked many policy debates. Under 30% of Australians completely own their property, while approximately 30% of private households are composed of renters. As noted in the report, residental housing prices has typically seen strong annual growth, as have rental costs for the past decade [1]. This has led to several Australian cities such as Sydney and Auckland to be rated as some of the least affordable cities based on the ratio between housing prices and annual income [2].

# Home in the Outback: Predicting Housing Prices in Australia

Potential homeowners and renters in Australia face affordability concerns about housing combined with frequent underquoting of properties in the real estate industry, which makes determining the true price of a property paramount. Using sample Australian real estate data from Kaggle to predict prices based on factors such as listing agency, room number, and property type, buyers can more accurately determine which properties they can afford. *insert machine learning model performance here*

## Business & Data Understanding

According to Statistia, housing affordability is a significant issue in Australia that has sparked many policy debates. Under 30% of Australians completely own their property, while approximately 30% of private households are composed of renters. As noted in the report, residental housing prices has typically seen strong annual growth, as have rental costs for the past decade [1]. This has led to several Australian cities such as Sydney and Auckland to be rated as some of the least affordable cities based on the ratio between housing prices and annual income [2].

Such an issue has also been compounded by the frequent practice of underquoting housing in the Australian real estate industry. Various organizations operating in the space have noted that "underquoting remains 'endemic' due to poorly regulated and underpoliced regulations". While the practice helps listers to gather more interested buyers, it also obfuscates the true price, creating much grief among hopeful buyers. As David Morrell, a buyers advocate in Australia, puts it: "It’s misleading, it’s a fraud on purchasers. And until significant penalties are handed out, regulations have been ineffective … if one does it, others have to follow" [3].

A housing price model can aid in mitigating the issue until stronger laws punishing underquoting are passed. By estimating the price of housing through the usage of a model, buyers can more accurately determine which properties they can afford in the Australian real estate market. This saves them time searching through properties that have an unknown true price, while aiding them in spotting potential homes on discount.
